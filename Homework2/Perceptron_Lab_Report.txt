The accuracy of our model decreased by ~0.10 when we took away the bias unit. 
This is because our bias unit helps increase the accuracy of our model as it
trains though the linear data set. The bias unit will also always output some 
non-zero value for our model's activation function and when its weight is also
a non-zero value. This is an important feature when all of our features (both x0 
and x1) for a given data point are equal to zero, hence making the output of the 
model equal to the trained weight of the bias unit at the given time of training
or testing.

Filter: Filters are two dimensional planes that wash over and detects distinct features in the pixels of an image. Examples of such features can be lines, or abstract concepts humans cannot comprehend. Filters can also be edited to format a specific size, speed, and sample size.
Feature: Features are as aforementioned, the characteristics that the filters search for, that define many shapes. A successful neural network attempts to use such features to find correlation between images.
Feature Map: A 2-dimensional representation of an image with values of the same number as pixels. The values stand for the color value of the pixel typically,  and shows how features match the characteristics in an image.
Pooling: Pooling is a function used to reduce the size of a layer by compressing the image. The most common types of pooling is maxpooling and minpooling, which takes the highest value in a specific range, or the lowest value, respectfully. By compressing the image, the neural network can more effectively determine efficient methods of training.
